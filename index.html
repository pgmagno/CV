            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p class="mybio">My name is Paulo Giovanny Sipaúba Magno and I am a Software Engineer student based in São Luís-Ma, Brazil. I am currently working as an English teacher.</p>

                <h3>Teacher</h3>
                <p>After getting a bachelor's degree in Law, I was at a crossroads. I didn't enjoy working as a Lawyer and at the same time I didn't have any other skills that would provide money.
                Admittedly, becoming a teacher wasn't my first choice and it came much more as a means to an end than passion or even inclination, really. But English was, though, something
                that I knew well. Then I became a teacher at an English course and so have I been for 10 years now, and I grew quite fond of it, when the conditions are satisfactory that is.

                <h3>Programmer</h3>
                <p>Programming, on the other hand, was actually my first choice, but being the green unexperienced boy that I was, and lacking the family support necessary to see it through,
                I left a bachelor course in Informational Systems after two semesters. <br><br> More than ten years later, and always developing myself indirectly, I finally got back to it. In
                2020, I mustered up the courage to believe in myself and so I started a course of Software Engineering which now really feels like the best decision ever.</p>
